    <pre>Salve magna parens frugum Saturnia tellus,

        While you, my Lord, the rural shades admire,
        And from Britannia's public posts retire,
        Nor longer, her ungrateful sons to please,
        For their advantage sacrifice your ease;
        
        Me into foreign realms my fate conveys,
        Through nations fruitful of immortal lays,
        Where the soft season and inviting clime
        Conspire to trouble your repose with rhyme.</pre>
